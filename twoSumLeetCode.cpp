/*
    Problem:
Given an array of integers, find the two numbers whose product (multiplication) is equal to a given target. Return their indices.

Example Input:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 6], target = 6
Example Output:

[1, 2]
Explanation: 2 * 3 == 6, so we return the indices [1, 2].

Hint: You can modify the solution for Two Sum slightly to solve this! Youâ€™ll check for multiplication instead of addition.
